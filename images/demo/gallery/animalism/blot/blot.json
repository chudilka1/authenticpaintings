  "description": "This artpiece is done with oil on canvas. 'Blot' is related to realism being a representative of animalistic genre. A playful little kitten is an important semantic detail of the work. After all, a cat is considered to be one of the best antidepressants posessing such qualities as being graceful, gentle, the embodiment of comfort - and, on the other hand, a repository of vices: lustful, lazy, impudent... \n\nThis work took part in several art exhibitions approved by several certificates.\n\nPay attention: Upon buying the digitalized copy of this masterpiece in Ultra HD 1:1 resolution, you will receive the original physical Authentic Painting.",
