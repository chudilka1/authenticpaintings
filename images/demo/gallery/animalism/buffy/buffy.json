  "description": "This artpiece is done with oil on canvas. 'Buffy' is related to realism being a representative of animalistic genre. A cat, as a symbolic detail of visual arts, is considered to be one of the best antidepressants posessing such qualities as being graceful, gentle, the embodiment of comfort - and, on the other hand, a repository of vices: lustful, lazy, impudent... Having come a long way from being honored as a deity to an ordinary representative of the urban fauna, cats certainly occupied a strong place in human culture. \n\nThis artwork took part in several art festivals and exhibitions approved by corresponding certificates.\n\nPay attention: Upon buying the digitalized copy of this masterpiece in Ultra HD 1:1 resolution, you will receive the original physical Authentic Painting.",
