  "description": "A horse is considered to be a symbolic image in arts, a representation of power and perfection. Many emotions compose it: strength, swiftness, majestic beauty, devotion and at the same time weekness and vulnerability... The image of a cobra in a fighting stance stands for a danger and hidden warning. This artpiece is done with oil on canvas.
