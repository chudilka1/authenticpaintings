  "description": "This artpiece is done with oil on canvas. 'Big Shell' is related to pointllism and devisionism style being a representative of still-life genre. This very special technique is based on writing with separate (non-isolated) strokes of the correct point or rectangular shapes. Looking at this painting it seems like the objects are appearing from nowhere, they look like real 3D ones. Very impressive.",
