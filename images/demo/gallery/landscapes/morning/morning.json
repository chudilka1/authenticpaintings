  "description": "This one is written by one of the outstanding landscapes painters Vladimir Grubnik. With an extraordinary skill the artist managed to convey the atmosphere of a summer and warm morning. Just look at those neat thin lines of the foreground grass drawn by the hand of the artist, at the light specks of meadow flowers, at the variegated silhouettes of foliage and tree crowns. This artpiece is done with oil on canvas. 'Morning' is related to impressionism being a representative of landscapes genre.",
